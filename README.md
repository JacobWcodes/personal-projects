# Expanding Cards Project

First project of Brad Traversy's '50 Projects in 50 Days' course.

I did look up a few small things, like the specific dimensions Brad uses in this mini project so that mine can look the same. I also looked up a few other things in the CSS just to get an idea of how big to expand the cards when they are 'active'.

I wrote, however, all of the Javascript myself without looking at any of his code. The project took me around 2.5 - 3 hours. Was a fun little project!
